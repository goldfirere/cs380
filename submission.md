We will be using [Gradescope] to collect assignments and offer feedback. Gradescope
allows for your work to be evaluated as you submit, with tests run against your code.
You may then resubmit as often as you like.

After you submit, I will also look through your work and offer line-by-line style
feedback, all through this website. When I am done grading, I will publish the
grades on the site; you will be notified when this happens.

You will need to create an account at [Gradescope]. After you do, you can add a
course. Use course code MK7RVM, which will link your account to CS380.

The submission process itself is quite easy; you should be able to follow the instructions
on the site. Do *not* change the filename of the homework, as the autograder expects the
file to be as I have given it to you. The one surprise may be that the resubmit
button is all the way at the bottom right -- it can be easy to miss.

Do let me know if you run into trouble!
