Bill MacKenty recommended c9.io (cloudnine) as a good web-based IDE. Could this be a platform for 380? Perhaps.

"technical thoughts on stack" thread (Sep 2016) includes posts by Michael Snoyman explaining how to use stack to install a system GHC. This may be useful for students.

Can I incorporate real papers? Perhaps functional pearls. (Yorgey's monoids paper? Comonads paper?)

Use GHC-vis: http://felsin9.de/nnis/ghc-vis/

  --> This is pretty awesome. Especially for infinite data structures

Also, consider:
 - iHaskell
 - Intero (<-- Emacs plugin that's supposedly good. Needs stack. But that's probably OK.)
 - HyperHaskell
 - Diagrams
 - Gloss

  - parenthesize type signatures
  - specialize class-constrained types



Use learn.hfm.io, Gabi and Manuel's tutorial for Haskell For Mac.
