CS 380: Modern Functional Programming
=====================================

Welcome to the Git home of CS380, a computer science course at
[Bryn Mawr College](http://cs.brynmawr.edu/).

Please visit the [course web page](http://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs380/spring2017)
for more information and the course syllabus.

Why not post the course web page here?
--------------------------------------

GitHub does a great job at rendering these Markdown files, but a course web page
tends to be a little more involved, especially considering the tabular syllabus
page.

Notes for the general public
----------------------------

If you're not a student in my course, you're probably viewing this at
<https://github.com/goldfirere/cs380>. This repo will not be updated
regularly, but if you want something here that isn't, just ask. I will update
this when the course is done. (I use a private repo for my class's daily
operation, allowing students to protect their privacy if they ask questions /
post PRs / etc.)
