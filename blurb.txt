Modern functional programming
-----------------------------

Simplify your language and free your mind. This course will cover an alternative
style of programming: typed functional programming. Typed functional programming languages
are quickly gaining currency in industry, including at Google, Facebook, a variety of
financial services companies, and across a range of startups. They are particularly
good at maintaining security guarantees and for writing concurrent programs.
This course will explore
the ease and wonder of typed functional programming through one such language: Haskell.
We will cover higher-order functions,
purity, generalized algebraic datatypes, type inference, laziness, monads, and more.
Once you have used these techniques, programming will never feel the same again.
Prerequisites: CMSC B206 or H106, and MATH/CMSC 231.
