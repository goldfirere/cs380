Note: There are a *lot* of functions this week. The long list is meant to give you flexibility in choosing what you care to
work on. Don't spend more than, say, 8 hours on this!

1. Write the following functions, adapted from their [list](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-8.5/base-4.9.1.0/GHC-OldList.html) versions.
   You will need `EVec` and `Fin` for these. Use as tight a constraint on `EVec` as you can.

    a. `concatMap`
    b. `unfoldr`
    c. `takeWhile`
    d. `dropWhile`
    e. `dropWhileEnd`
    f. `filter`
    g. `(!!)` (uses `Fin`)
    h. `elemIndex` (uses `Fin`)
    i. `elemIndices` (uses `EVec` *and* `Fin`)
    j. `findIndex` (uses `Fin`)
    k. `findIndices` (uses `EVec` *and* `Fin`)
    l. `nub`
    m. `delete` (this can get a tighter constraint than, say, `filter`)
    n. `(\\)`
    o. `union`
    p. `intersect`

2. The following functions cannot be translated to work on `Vec` with the existing structures we have. But you know enough to come
up with fresh GADTs to encode the right invariants. Aim for your type indices to be as expressive as possible.

    a. `span`
    b. `break`
    c. `partition`
    d. `group`
